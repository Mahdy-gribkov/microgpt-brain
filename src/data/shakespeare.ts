export const SHAKESPEARE = `To be, or not to be, that is the question
Whether tis nobler in the mind to suffer
The slings and arrows of outrageous fortune
Or to take arms against a sea of troubles
And by opposing end them To die to sleep
No more and by a sleep to say we end
The heartache and the thousand natural shocks
That flesh is heir to tis a consummation
Devoutly to be wished To die to sleep
To sleep perchance to dream ay theres the rub
For in that sleep of death what dreams may come
When we have shuffled off this mortal coil
Must give us pause theres the respect
That makes calamity of so long life
For who would bear the whips and scorns of time
The oppressors wrong the proud mans contumely
The pangs of despised love the laws delay
The insolence of office and the spurns
That patient merit of the unworthy takes
When he himself might his quietus make
With a bare bodkin Who would fardels bear
To grunt and sweat under a weary life
But that the dread of something after death
The undiscovered country from whose bourn
No traveller returns puzzles the will
And makes us rather bear those ills we have
Than fly to others that we know not of
Thus conscience does make cowards of us all
And thus the native hue of resolution
Is sicklied oer with the pale cast of thought
And enterprises of great pith and moment
With this regard their currents turn awry
And lose the name of action
All the worlds a stage
And all the men and women merely players
They have their exits and their entrances
And one man in his time plays many parts
His acts being seven ages At first the infant
Mewling and puking in the nurses arms
Then the whining schoolboy with his satchel
And shining morning face creeping like snail
Unwillingly to school And then the lover
Sighing like furnace with a woeful ballad
Made to his mistress eyebrow Then a soldier
Full of strange oaths and bearded like the pard
Jealous in honor sudden and quick in quarrel
Seeking the bubble reputation
Even in the cannons mouth And then the justice
In fair round belly with good capon lined
With eyes severe and beard of formal cut
Full of wise saws and modern instances
And so he plays his part The sixth age shifts
Into the lean and slippered pantaloon
With spectacles on nose and pouch on side
His youthful hose well saved a world too wide
For his shrunk shank and his big manly voice
Turning again toward childish treble pipes
And whistles in his sound Last scene of all
That ends this strange eventful history
Is second childishness and mere oblivion
Sans teeth sans eyes sans taste sans everything
If music be the food of love play on
Give me excess of it that surfeiting
The appetite may sicken and so die
That strain again it had a dying fall
O it came oer my ear like the sweet sound
That breathes upon a bank of violets
Stealing and giving odour Enough no more
Tis not so sweet now as it was before
O spirit of love how quick and fresh art thou
That notwithstanding thy capacity
Receiveth as the sea naught enters there
Of what validity and pitch soeer
But falls into abatement and low price
Even in a minute So full of shapes is fancy
That it alone is high fantastical
Romeo Romeo wherefore art thou Romeo
Deny thy father and refuse thy name
Or if thou wilt not be but sworn my love
And I ll no longer be a Capulet
What s in a name That which we call a rose
By any other name would smell as sweet
So Romeo would were he not Romeo called
Retain that dear perfection which he owes
Without that title Romeo doff thy name
And for that name which is no part of thee
Take all myself
The quality of mercy is not strained
It droppeth as the gentle rain from heaven
Upon the place beneath It is twice blest
It blesseth him that gives and him that takes
Tis mightiest in the mightiest it becomes
The throned monarch better than his crown
His sceptre shows the force of temporal power
The attribute to awe and majesty
Wherein doth sit the dread and fear of kings
But mercy is above this sceptred sway
It is enthroned in the hearts of kings
It is an attribute to God himself
And earthly power doth then show likest Gods
When mercy seasons justice`;
